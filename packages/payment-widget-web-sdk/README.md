A Web SDK for the Enterprise Payment Widget.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install @uphold/payment-widget-web-sdk
```

## Usage

You must obtain a payment widget session before you can use the widget. Use the [`Create Payment Widget Session`](https://developer.uphold.com/rest-apis/widgets-api/payment/create-session) endpoint from the **Enterprise REST API**, providing the desired widget flow and the user context for the operation.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always make the `Create Payment Widget Session` request from your backend, not the browser. This ensures sensitive information, such as client credentials, is not exposed to the client-side.

With the payment session in hand, you can initialize the widget and mount it to a DOM element:

```javascript
import {
  PaymentWidget,
  type PaymentWidgetCompleteEvent,
  type WidgetCancelEvent,
  type WidgetErrorEvent
} from '@uphold/enterprise-payment-widget-web-sdk';

// This is the payment session object you received from the `Create Payment Widget Session`.
const paymentSession = {};

// Initialize the widget with the payment session.
const widget = new PaymentWidget(paymentSession);

// Register event handlers.
widget.on('complete', (e: PaymentWidgetCompleteEvent) => {
  // 'complete' event is raised when the user completes the flow.
  console.log(`'complete' event raised. Account id: `, e.detail.externalAccountId);
  widget.unmount();
});

widget.on('cancel', (_: WidgetCancelEvent) => {
  // 'cancel' event is raised when the user cancels the flow.
  console.log(`'cancel' event raised`);
  widget.unmount();
});

widget.on('error', (e: WidgetErrorEvent) => {
  // 'error' event is raised when the widget encounters an unrecoverable error.
  console.log(`'error' event raised. error: `, e.detail.error);
  widget.unmount();
});

// Mount the widget in an iframe on a DOM element.
widget.mountIframe(document.getElementById('payment-widget-root'));
```

### Debugging

The `debug` option enables additional logging to the console, which can help during development. To enable debugging, set the `debug` option to `true` when initializing the widget:

```javascript
const widget = new PaymentWidget(paymentSession, { debug: true });
```
