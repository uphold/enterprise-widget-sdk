A Web SDK for the Enterprise Travel Rule Widget.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install @uphold/travel-rule-widget-web-sdk
```

## Usage

You must obtain a travel rule widget session before you can use the widget. Use the [`Create Travel Rule Widget Session`](https://developer.uphold.com/rest-apis/widgets-api/travel-rule/create-session) endpoint from the **Enterprise REST API**, providing the desired widget flow and the user context for the operation.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always make the `Create Travel Rule Widget Session` request from your backend, not the browser. This ensures sensitive information, such as client credentials, is not exposed to the client-side.

With the travel rule session in hand, you can initialize the widget and mount it to a DOM element:

```javascript
import {
  TravelRuleWidget,
  type TravelRuleWidgetCompleteEvent,
  type WidgetCancelEvent,
  type WidgetErrorEvent
} from '@uphold/enterprise-travel-rule-widget-web-sdk';

// This is the travel rule session object you received from the `Create Travel Rule Widget Session`.
const travelRuleSession = {};

// Initialize the widget with the travel rule session.
// Accepts an optional type parameter `TFlow` which narrows
// the type of the `complete` event.
const widget = new TravelRuleWidget<'withdrawal-form'>(travelRuleSession);

// Register event handlers.
widget.on('complete', (e: TravelRuleWidgetCompleteEvent) => {
  // 'complete' event is raised when the user completes the flow.
  console.log(`'complete' event raised. Account id: `, e.detail.selection.id);
  widget.unmount();
});

widget.on('cancel', (_: TravelRuleWidgetCancelEvent) => {
  // 'cancel' event is raised when the user cancels the flow.
  console.log(`'cancel' event raised`);
  widget.unmount();
});

widget.on('error', (e: TravelRuleWidgetErrorEvent) => {
  // 'error' event is raised when the widget encounters an unrecoverable error.
  console.log(`'error' event raised. error: `, e.detail.error);
  widget.unmount();
});

// Mount the widget in an iframe on a DOM element.
widget.mountIframe(document.getElementById('travel-rule-widget-root'));
```

### Debugging

The `debug` option enables additional logging to the console, which can help during development. To enable debugging, set the `debug` option to `true` when initializing the widget:

```javascript
const widget = new TravelRuleWidget(travelRuleSession, { debug: true });
```
